# Cool Things

Few cool things (酷東西) around my daily nerdy life 

## Chrome extensions

* [Tab Muter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-muter/bnclejfcblondkjliiblkojdeloomadd?hl=en): Mute site is NOT cool, Mute tab IS

## Draw, Diagram, Collaboration, Whiteboard

* [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/): Draw architecture diagram like a PRO
* [Whimsical](https://whimsical.com/): Beautiful flow chart and all kinds of wireframe
